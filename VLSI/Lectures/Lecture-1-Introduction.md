# 1. Preparation of Silicon Substrate 
- The starting raw material is silica, or silicon dioxide (SiO2). (Almost 60% of the earth's crust is silica).
- The starting raw material (SiO2) is purified, and its impurities are removed. Then, SiO2 is heated in the presence of carbon. This breaks the SiO 2 into silicon (Si) and carbon dioxide (CO2).
- Silicon still retains impurities, to remove most of these, the silicon is exposed to an appropriate gas reacts with impurities (carbon, aluminum, and magnesium), and they leave as part of the gas.
- Silicon still has some impurities, so it is converted to a liquid called trichlorosilane (SiHCI3). Then SiHCl3 is converted to a pure silicon by a deposition method in which vaporized SiHCl3 is reacted with hydrogen gas, precipitating silicon
- This kind of silicon is a polycrystalline material
- To turn polycrystalline silicon into single-crystal silicon, it is melted and allowed to solidify in such a way that the silicon atoms arrange themselves in the desired position.
- This is done by placing a small single-crystal piece of silicon (called a seed crystal) on the end of a rod and dipped into molten silicon.
