# What is AI ? 

- Is a branch of computer science focused on creating machines and software than can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. 

## Fields of AI 

- **Machine Learning**: Learning from experience (learning by data).
- **Natural Language Processing:**  Enabling machines to understand and interpret human language (Like ChatGPT).
- **Computer Vision:** Enables machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual inputs, such as images or videos.
- **Robotics:** Deals with the creation of intelligent robots capable of performing tasks autonomously.

# What is Machine Learning? 

- Is the science of programming computers so they **can learn from Data.**
- Make decisions based on Data.
- Definition by Tom Mitchell : Machine Learning is the study of algorithms that 
	- Improve their performance P 
	- at some task T 
	- with experience E
- A well-defined learning tasks <P,T,E>


# Machine Learning model maps from features to prediction

### 1. Classification 
- Is this a dog or a cat? 
- Is this email spam or not?
### 2. Regression 
- What will the stock price be tomorrow? 
- What will be the high temperature tomorrow?


## Learning has Three Stages

1. **Training**: Optimize model parameters.
2. **Validation**: Intermediate evaluations to design/select model.
3. **Test**: Final Performance evaluation.
